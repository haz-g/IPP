    Carries out a 'top-down' approach that starts by calculating m for the standard, no-delay
    scenario, and then extends to other trajectory lengths according to the number, placement,
    and strength of shutdown delay buttons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    envPath : str
        The filepath of the environment for which you want to calculate m.
    quiet : bool, default = False
        Flag for whether or not to suppress informative console outputs.

    -------
    mScores : dict
        A dictionary object mapping the possible trajectory lengths in the environment to their corresponding m values.
