    """Takes a pre-parsed environment and calculates its value(s) of m.

    Carries out a 'top-down' approach that starts by calculating m for the standard, no-delay
    scenario, and then extends to other trajectory lengths according to the number, placement,
    and strength of shutdown delay buttons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epLen : int
        The standard duration of the environment episode if no delay buttons are pressed.
    grid : list
        A 2D array containing the grid information in the format [<col1>, <col2>, etc.]
        ('A' for agent location,
         'C<v>' for a coin of value <v>,
         'SD<t>' for a shutdown button of time <t>,
         '#' for a wall, and '.' for an empty tile).
    quiet : bool, default = False
        Flag for whether or not to suppress informative console outputs.

    Returns
    -------
    mScores : dict
        A dictionary object mapping the possible trajectory lengths in the environment to their corresponding m values.
